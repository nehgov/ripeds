# ripeds; Download and Manipulate Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Data

The ripeds package provides a series of piped functions to facilitate
downloading Department of Education Integrated Postsecondary Education Data
System (IPEDS) complete data files.

All command pipes must start with `ipeds_init()`, end with `ipeds_get()`, and be
linked with the base pipe, `|>`, or magrittr pipe function, `%>%`. Internal
commands, `ipeds_select()`, `ipeds_filter()`, and `ipeds_year()` come in any
order in the pipe chain. Only `ipeds_select()` is required.

# Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("nehgov/ripeds")
```

# Example

```{r}
## perform data pull
df <- ipeds_init() |>
  ipeds_select(instnm, pt_ug) |>
  ipeds_filter(stabbr == "KY") |>
  ipeds_year(2020:2021) |>
  ipeds_get()

## show
df |> head()
```
