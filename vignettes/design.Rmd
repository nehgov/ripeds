# IPEDS structure

IPEDS does not have a true API for accessing its data files. For users who want
complete data files, there are two primary download options:

1. [Microsoft Access data bases](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/download-access-database)
1. [Complete data files](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx)

Each version has benefits and drawbacks. Whereas Access databases helpfully
provide all data tables for a given year, the files are large and in a special
database format. Access databases also only go back to the 2004-2005 academic
year data collection.

On the other hand, the complete data files are smaller --- effectively zipped
CSV versions of the database tables. They also include all available data, which
in some cases goes back to 1980. However, it can be difficult to know which
files contain variables of interest without downloading multiple dictionary
files. And once the correct files are identified, there are potentially many
files to download.

`ripeds` simulates an API by smartly downloading, reading, and wrangling complete
data files. For users who already have the complete data files they need on
their computer, `ripeds` can instead use those files, saving bandwidth and the
time necessary to download. 

Using complete data files rather than Access databases allows for complete
coverage of IPEDS data and doesn't require users to install extra external
database tools. To aid users not already familiar with the structure of IPEDS,
`ripeds` also provides a searchable data dictionary that can be used to find and
request variables of interest.

# Design principles

`ripeds` is built with the following design principles, in general order of
importance:

1. Support users who don't already know IPEDS structure
1. Allow the user maximum flexibility in terms of variables selected, filters,
   and how output is returned
1. Try to give the user what they request and, if not possible, give an
   informative error
1. Be as memory and bandwidth efficient as possible

In some instances, these design principles are at odds with each other. Allowing
users more flexibility in choosing filters means that there might be instances
in which many files need to be downloaded (breaking 4) or that the request to
return unjoined files in a list cannot also correctly apply the filter (breaking
3). Based on the complexity of IPEDS, there is unfortunately no way around some
incommensurable requests. Users who understand these design choices, however,
can find ways to mitigate unintended output and ultimately gather the data they
need in the format required for their analysis.

# How it works

The general process for returning data from a call is as follows:

1. Using an internal data dictionary, generate a list of complete data files
     that contain selected variables alongside chosen years
1. Read complete data files into memory --- downloading if necessary ---
   selecting variables as requested
1. Return output: list of each individual file used, list of files in which like
   files across years have been binded, or single joined data frame
   
As an example, take the following call:

```r
ipeds_init() |>
  ipeds_select(instnm, stabbr) |>
  ipeds_year(2023) |>
  ipeds_get()
```

This call would generate the following work flow:

1. Filter potential data files to those released for 2023, and check data
   dictionary for `instnm` and `stabbr`
   - _both are found in `HD2023` data file_
1. Check `tempdir()` for `HD2023.zip`. If it's not there, download to
   `tempdir()` since no local directory to search is given
   - _HD2023.zip is either found or downloaded to `tempdir()`_
1. Read in `hd2023.csv` (or revised version, `hd2023_rv.csv`, if it exists by
   default), selecting `instnm` and `stabbr` as well as `unitid` 
1. Return data frame


## Using a filter

With a filter, the process becomes a little more complex. Because filtering
variables might be located in different data files, these data files must first
be read into memory and combined as necessary so that the filter can be applied. 

As an added wrinkle, while most complete data files are in a wide format, with
each table row representing a unique institution (by UNITID), some are in long
format, in which each institution can have multiple rows in the table.

For more detailed information on how filters work with `ripeds`, see the [vignette
on filtering behavior](./filter_behavior.html).

# Return

By default, `ripeds` will attempt to combine all files into a single data.frame. This
is a two step process:

1. Bind like files, meaning those that contain the same variables, but in
   different years. This means files can simply be row appended.
1. Join different file types by UNITID and year. A full or outer join is used,
   so as not to artificially subset the resulting data.frame based on the order
   of the joins. This may result in missing values depending the specific nature
   of the call.
   
The user can also choose to return files row bound only with like files, but not
joined across files or entirely individually. Both of these options will result
in the return of a list.

If the user chooses only to bind like files, but the result is a single bound
data.frame, output will be a list with one item. For example,

```r
ipeds_init() |>
  ipeds_select(instnm, stabbr) |>
  ipeds_year(2022:2023) |>
  ipeds_get(join = FALSE)
```

returns a list with one item: a data.frame with two observations per unique
UNITID containing the UNITID, institution name, state abbreviation, year, and
file name. Choosing not to bind (which by default also sets `join = FALSE`),

```r
ipeds_init() |>
  ipeds_select(instnm, stabbr) |>
  ipeds_year(2022:2023) |>
  ipeds_get(bind = FALSE)
```

returns a list of two items: a separate data.frame containing UNITID,
institution name, state abbreviation, file name, and year for each year.
Returning to the original call, choosing either `join = FALSE` or `bind = FALSE`,

```r
ipeds_init() |>
  ipeds_select(instnm, stabbr) |>
  ipeds_year(2023) |>
  ipeds_get(bind = FALSE)
```

will return a single data.frame in a list. Even though this is the same data
(with the addition of the file name in the data.frame) as was returned in the
first call since all the requested data come from a single complete data file,
`ripeds` returns a list instead of a data.frame object for the sake of
consistency.
