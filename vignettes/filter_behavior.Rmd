ripeds makes a distinction between filters that use variables from wide data
files versus those from long data files. In general, ripeds will apply filters
as follows:

- **wide**: filter(s) applied in a preprocessing step that will produce a
  data.frame of UNITID by YEAR, which will be used in the primary selection
  stage to keep only those institution/year pairs returned by the filter
- **long**: filter(s) applied in a postprocessing step after primary selection
  stage
