## Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System

For those interested in data in higher education institutions in the United
States, IPEDS is an invaluable resource. What is IPEDS? From the National Center
for Education Statistics (NCES) [web site](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/about-ipeds):

> IPEDS is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. It is a system of
> interrelated surveys conducted annually by the U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s
> National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). IPEDS gathers information
> from every college, university, and technical and vocational institution that
> participates in the federal student financial aid programs. The Higher
> Education Act of 1965, as amended, requires that institutions that participate
> in federal student aid programs report data on enrollments, program
> completions, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional
> prices, and student financial aid.

IPEDS covers most higher education institutions (though not all):

> The completion of all IPEDS surveys is mandatory for institutions that
> participate in or are applicants for participation in any federal student
> financial aid program (such as Pell grants and federal student loans)
> authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 USC
> 1094, Section 487(a)(17) and 34 CFR 668.14(b)(19)).

> Institutions that complete IPEDS surveys each year include research
> universities, state colleges and universities, private religious and liberal
> arts colleges, for-profit institutions, community and technical colleges,
> non-degree-granting institutions such as beauty colleges, and others.

## Using IPEDS

There are a number of ways to use IPEDS data. For information on single
institutions, a person can use the [College
Navigator](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/). NCES also provides a [Data
Explorer}(https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/search) with a number pre-made tables that
some may find sufficient. 

For researchers interested in analyses across many institutions, however, the
complete data files, either as shared via Microsoft Access databases or separate
CSV files are the most useful. Whereas Access databases go back to the 2004-2005
school year, the CSV versions of the data files contain some information as far
back as 1980.

## IPEDS does not have an API and is complex

Unlike some other federal data sources on higher education (like the [College
Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov)), IPEDS does not have an API that
allows users to directly pull data for analyses or applications.

In addition, the structure of IPEDS can be complex. Downloading separate CSV
files requires users to both understand where to find variables of interest and
how to append / join these files into a single data frame that can be analyzed.

## Purpose of `ripeds`

The purpose of this package is threefold:

1. To provide an API-like interface between IPEDS and R;
1. To facilitate finding and pulling relevant variables without requiring
   detailed knowledge IPEDS's structure via an interactive dictionary function;
1. To make it easy to batch download large parts of IPEDS (including full
   dictionary files) for power users who need to save the original files on
   their machine, but would like an easier and automated way of getting them.
